# Deepgram Voice-Activated Order Assistant Demo

A voice-enabled conversational assistant for inventory managers to query order status, delivery schedules, items, shipping addresses, and vendor information across multiple store locations. This demo showcases integration of Deepgram’s real-time speech-to-text API using GPT-4 for natural language understanding, providing a seamless voice interface accessible via both a terminal app and a Streamlit web app.

## Overview

Inventory managers require quick, hands-free access to order-related information across multiple stores. This assistant listens to spoken queries, transcribes speech in real time via Deepgram, interprets intent with GPT-4, and fetches relevant data from order records, responding verbally and in text.

## Features

- Real-time speech recognition with Deepgram streaming API  
- Conversational AI powered by OpenAI GPT-4  
- Multi-turn dialogue context management  
- Query order status, delivery date, items, shipping address, and vendor details  
- Session control with start/end calls  
- Runs both as terminal CLI and interactive Streamlit web application

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher  
- Deepgram API Key ([Sign up here](https://developers.deepgram.com))  

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepgram-order-assistant.git
cd deepgram-order-assistant

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Create a `.env` file in the root directory containing:

```env
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
```

## Usage

* **Terminal:**
  Run the voice assistant in the terminal with:

  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

* **Web App (Streamlit):**
  Launch the interactive voice assistant web app:

  ```bash
  streamlit run app.py
  ```

* Speak naturally to ask questions like:

	* "What is the status of order 10001?"
	* "Tell me the delivery address for order 10023."
	* "List the items in order 10100."
	* "Who is the vendor for order 10023?"


## Configuration

* `agent_config.py`: Customize prompts, models, and function definitions.
* `agent_functions.py`: Backend logic to query orders and map spoken IDs to real data.
* `/data/`: Contains the CSV datasets (`orders.csv` and `order_items.csv`) with order and item data.

```

## Testing

Automated tests are included to verify the core backend functions such as order ID normalization and order data retrieval.

### Running Tests

Make sure you have `pytest` installed (it should be included in `requirements.txt`):

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Run the tests from the root project directory:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

The tests cover functions like:

* `normalize_order_id`: Converts spoken order IDs to normalized strings
* `get_order_status`: Retrieves order shipment status
* `get_order_items`: Lists items in an order
* `get_delivery_address`: Fetches shipping address
* `get_vendor_name`: Gets vendor information
* `get_delivery_date`: Returns estimated delivery date

This ensures your backend logic behaves as expected.



## Docker Usage

### Build and Run the Docker Container

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
podman build -t deepgram-voice-assistant:latest .
# or with docker:
# docker build -t deepgram-voice-assistant:latest .
```

2. Run the container (map port 8501 and pass your `.env` file):

```bash
podman run -d -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env --name deepgram-voice-assistant deepgram-voice-assistant:latest
# or with docker:
# docker run -d -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env --name deepgram-voice-assistant deepgram-voice-assistant:latest
```

3. Access the app in your browser at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).



### Important Note on macOS

Due to macOS architecture and container isolation, **Docker containers cannot access your Mac's microphone or speaker hardware**. This affects real-time audio features like speech input and output.

#### ⚠️ Why Real-Time Voice Doesn't Work in Docker on macOS

* **Docker on macOS uses a Linux VM**: Docker Desktop for Mac runs a lightweight Linux virtual machine (VM) to host the Docker daemon and containers.
* **Hardware Isolation**: This VM isolates containers from the Mac host’s hardware, including audio devices.
* **No Direct Sound Access**: Applications inside the container cannot access the host's sound card or `/dev/snd`, which are essential for audio input/output.

#### Workarounds (Advanced)

You *can* try setting up a **PulseAudio** server on the Mac host and configuring the container to use it. This involves:

* Installing and running a PulseAudio server on your Mac
* Exposing it to the Docker container over a TCP socket
* Configuring ALSA or PyAudio inside the container to route through PulseAudio

However, this approach is **not seamless**, requires manual setup, and is **outside the scope of this project**.

#### Recommendation

For full voice functionality (microphone and speaker access):

* **Run the app natively on your Mac** (outside Docker) using the instructions in the [Usage](#usage) section.
* Use Docker only for UI deployments in remote or cloud environments where audio devices are properly exposed.
